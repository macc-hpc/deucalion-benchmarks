The IO-500 has been developed together with the community and its development is still ongoing. The benchmark is essentially a benchmark suite bundled with execution rules. It harnesses existing and trusted open source benchmarks.

The goal for the benchmark is to capture user-experienced performance. It aims to be:

---------------------------------------------------

- Representative
- Understandable
- Scalable
- Portable
- Inclusive
- Lightweight
- Trustworthy

The benchmark covers various workloads and computes a single score for comparison. The workloads are:

- IOEasy: Applications with well optimized I/O patterns
- IOHard: Applications that require a random workload
- MDEasy: Metadata/small objects
- MDHard: Small files (3901 bytes) in a shared directory
- Find: Finding relevant objects based on patterns

The individual performance numbers are preserved and accessible via the web or the raw data. This allows deriving other relevant metrics
